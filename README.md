## Update No. 1

Okay, after noticing the binary numbers of 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 64, in the denominator.  My curiosity peaked
and checked out the Python Code on Github the floatobject.c  See Line 1513.

[Python Github - Float Object.c](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/main/Objects/floatobject.c)

This was interesting that all the denominators are exponentials of 2.  I tested the numererators and those were just random.

After reading the floatobject.c  This makes a lot more sense.  I could see from the timestamps on Github this library is being updated all the time.
Your results may vary when you look at cpythons code.

## Ending

I am going to end this here.  Need to work on other stuff.
